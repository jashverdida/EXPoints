Project title: EXPoints

Description: This project is a PHP-based web platform that allows users to browse, search, and read reviews for video games across all platforms and eras. It solves the problem of scattered and unreliable game information by providing a centralized, gamified, and moderated space where gamers can access trustworthy reviews. Registered users can submit their own reviews with star ratings, comment on others’ reviews, and earn XP Points for their interactions, fostering engagement and rewarding quality contributions. An Admin oversees all user accounts, manages moderation, and can manually create accounts for users unable to register themselves, while Moderators assist in reviewing and removing inappropriate content to maintain a safe and respectful community.
